2. PEP8 is the style guide for python. This style guide provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code. [You can take a look at this guide here;](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and should strive to adhere to these guidelines.
